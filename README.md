# To-Do-List # Python

This project allows the user to create and save To-Do list as he chooses the tasks he wants to acheive.
After running the code, you'll receive few options. Everything is explained and very easy to use. 

The options: 
1. Add Task.
2. View Tasks.
3. Mark Completed Tasks.
4. Delete Task.
5. Save the list as a txt file on your computer.

The project is still in development I'm searching for new ways to improve my code, if anyone has any suggestions I'll be more than happy to listen :) 


Enjoy :)
