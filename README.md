This project allows the user to create and save a To-Do list by selecting the tasks they want to achieve.
After running the program, you’ll be presented with several options. Everything is explained and is very easy to use.

The options are:

Add Task
View Tasks
Mark Completed Tasks
Delete Task
Save the list as a .txt file on your computer

The project is still in development, and I’m always looking for ways to improve the code. If anyone has suggestions, I’d be more than happy to hear them! :)

In version 2.0, I created a desktop application with the same basic principles as version 1. However, instead of running in the terminal, the code now opens a desktop application using Tkinter.
Basic yet effective.

Enjoy! :)
